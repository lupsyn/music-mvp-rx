# Music-mvp-rx
A showcase of RxJava and Model View Presenter, plus a number of other popular libraries for android development, 
including Dagger2, Retrofit, and ButterKnife. 
Unit tests covering any business logic and Robolectric tests verifying the ui. 

The app is a simple master/detail implementation: 
we retrieve a list of elements from the Shazam api and present them on the `MusicFragment` in a `RecyclerView`. 
When an element is clicked on, we load it in by itself in the `MusicDetailFragment`.

## Benefits

This setup has a number of advantages over a non-MVP app architecture
 - it separates our concerns
    - the `Presenter` is view agnostic and does not care how an action was triggered, making a clear division which is easy to change
    - the view which implements the `View` interface is very simple - the methods are usually one liners, doing something on the android `Activity` e.g. just setting a view's state to `View.GONE` - which also makes them easy to test
 - it allows us to place all our business logic within the `Presenter` object and abstracts the `View` for easy mocking, so we can unit test all the things, e.g: 
    - when we're doing a network request, does the loading indicator show when it starts, and hide when it ends?
    - are we ignoring clicks on the 'refresh' button when a network call doing a refresh is already in progress?
    - what happens when a network call fails?
    - ... etc 
 - support for orientation changes (e.g. device rotation) with very little effort
 - the power of rxjava 
    - `Observable`s exposing future actions via the `View` interface, allowing our `Presenter`s to be entirely stateless
    - easy to do long running operations off the main thread
    - in app code but also in the unit tests, e.g the excellent `TestScheduler`  
    
## Implementation

 This project has a separate module called `mocks`. Our android application module `app` has a `testCompile`
 dependency on the `mocks` module.  (Injected with dagger)
 We have created a `LocalResponseDispatcher` which takes care of the local API needs,  we use `MockWebserver` to test the API calls.

 Also the testCompile in the `core` module depends on mocks in which we have stored .json response,
 in order to correctly test in Junit plain tests.
